# Hexapod Models

3D models and CAD files for my [Hexapod Project](https://github.com/Adam-Grman/hexapod).

## Structure

- **Source/** - Original model files (STL, STEP formats)
- **Edited/** - Modified and recreated parts
  - **Modified/** - Parts modified and other improvements
  - **Recreated/** - Experimental recreations (see warning below)
- **3DPrint/** - Ready-to-print 3MF files

## ⚠️ Warning About Recreated Folder

The parts in the `Edited/Recreated/` folder are experimental and **not recommended for use**. These were early attempts at recreating parts, and I plan to refactor them properly once I learn FreeCAD better.

## Tasks

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Recreate parts for M3 inserts
- [x] Modify existing parts to fit new requirements

### 📋 To Do
- [ ] Refactor the M3 parts properly with improved FreeCAD skills
- [ ] Clean up and finalize recreated components
- [ ] Clean up the repository structure and create a dedicated folder for final exported 3MF files
